How to use PennyLane and Backline for low-latency quantum error correction on GPUs and FPGAs
============================================================================================

The challenge today? Quantum is never purely quantum. Large-scale systems built for quantum computing, sensing, and
networking rely heavily on robust classical processing, from processing of applications to
low-level hardware control. Not only that, but tight communication and feedback between quantum
processors and classical accelerators are essential to identify and correct errors --- a process
known as `quantum error correction
<https://pennylane.ai/topics/fault-tolerant-quantum-computing>`__ (QEC) --- before fragile physical
information degrades.

In this demo, we will take a quantum error correction application and push it through increasing
levels of complexity and optimization, entirely from Python — scaling from local prototyping with CPUs, to
low-latency remote hardware execution with FPGAs, GPUs, and Triton.

Getting started
---------------

`Backline <https://xanadu.ai/docs/backline-whitepaper.pdf>`__ is an open platform for compilation and low-latency execution --- built within
PennyLane and `Catalyst <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst>`__ --- to dynamically connect
quantum workloads to the right classical engine (such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs). It allows
you to write high-level algorithmic logic in Python, and easily jump through abstraction layers to
write custom, highly optimized low-level hardware kernels.

To showcase this, we'll take an example of a workflow that requires low-latency execution ---
`quantum error correction <https://pennylane.ai/topics/fault-tolerant-quantum-computing>`__ --- and
begin prototyping immediately with CPUs, before progressively including consumer-grade and
enterprise GPUs and FPGAs — all from the same software environment.

To start with, we need to install the latest versions of PennyLane and Catalyst. We will need to
install these from source; we can follow the build instructions available in the `Catalyst
documentation <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/backline/blob/main/INSTALL.md>`__. To execute all of the demos,
including GPUs and FPGAs examples, you will need to make sure you have the required hardware
and software, including:

- A server with an AMD Instinct™ GPU, ROCm 6 or newer, and an RDMA NIC;
- An AMD Versal™ Premium Series VPK120 FPGA board.

If you would like to simply prototype using local CPUs (the first example in this demo), the above
hardware requirements are not necessary.

Now that you have Backline installed, let's get started!

Backlines, coprocessors, and controllers
----------------------------------------

There are three main components to Backline:

- **Controllers**: This is the classical hardware (such as a CPU or FPGA) that controls the QPU
  (a quantum hardware or simulator :func:`~pennylane.device`), receives quantum measurement
  results, and initiates data transfers with other hardware devices (*coprocessors*). For
  example, it might perform QEC syndrome measurements on the QPU, and send these to a coprocessor
  for decoding.

- **Coprocessors**: These are hardware devices (such as CPUs or GPUs) that receive
  information from a controller for processing. They run specific **coprocessing functions**,
  potentially as a persistent kernel.

- **Backline**: A representation of the complete hardware infrastructure supporting the
  quantum-classical program. The backline includes a controller, one or more coprocessors, and a
  transport method. A backline object is given directly to a QNode in place of a traditional
  QNode :func:`~pennylane.device`.

In the examples below, we'll see how to create our controller, coprocessors, and backline, and how
to use these to execute PennyLane programs.

Local CPU-to-CPU with a pre-compiled kernel
-------------------------------------------

First, we’ll start with a local CPU-CPU interaction — a great place to begin prototyping, as it
comes with significantly fewer specialized hardware barriers. The best thing is, this workflow
easily extends to remote workflows on specialized hardware (such as GPUs and FPGAs) with minimal
changes.

For the first example, we will encode a logical circuit using the :doc:`Steane code
<tutorial_bp_catalyst>` (:math:`[[7, 1, 3]]`), a specific type of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code
based on the classical :math:`[7, 4, 3]` `Hamming code
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code>`__. The Steane code encodes one logical qubit using 7
physical qubits, and has the ability to correct arbitrary single qubit errors.

Conveniently, we can leverage PennyLane to simply define a **logical circuit**, and point Catalyst
and Backline to existing optimization passes (for quantum error correction encoding) and
pre-compiled libraries (for decoding), to allow the error correction to occur automatically within
the stack.

We'll start by registering the Steane decoder. We will point to a pre-compiled library that comes
with Catalyst, but you can point this to any pre-compiled decoding library you wish to use.

# Next, we can create our two CPUs: the controller, and the coprocessor. The controller will run

#
# Remote CPU-to-GPU with a Python defined kernel
# ----------------------------------------------
# Next, we'll consider a *remote* CPU-to-GPU interaction using a Python-defined QEC decoding kernel,
# written using Triton. In this example, the controller and coprocessor are no longer local, but on
# a remote server. Furthermore, we'll show how you can program the GPU coprocessor directly from
# Python using the `Triton <https://triton-lang.org/main/index.html>`__ library for writing
# optimized GPU kernels.
#
# To further increase the complexity, this time we will upgrade our QEC encoding to use
# a :doc:`qLDPC code <tutorial_qldpc_codes>`, which leverages non-local connectivity between distant qubits to
# drastically reduce qubit overheads. In particular, we will use the :math:`[[13, 1, 3]]`
# Hypergraph Product code, a well-known family of qLDPC codes that uses 13 physical wires for
# encoding, and a single auxiliary wire to extract syndromes. To *decode* the qLDPC code, we will
# use a belief propagation decoder --- an iterative message-passing algorithm used to decode errors
# by working on the `Tanner graph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_graph>`__ of the code.
#
# To start with, we define our belief propagation decoder. We do so using two parity check
# matrices:

#     Behind the scenes, this function utilizes ``@triton.jit`` to compile an optimized GPU kernel ---
#     feel free to look under-the-hood at the `source code
#     <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/blob/main/pennylane/backline/functions.py#L134>`__ to
#     see how Triton is being used. Later in this demo, we will also show you how to compile your
#     own Triton function for Backline coprocessing.
#
# With the decoder defined, we can now create our controller and coprocessor. To start, we'll define
# our server configuration, representing our remote server carrying an AMD GPU and an RDMA capable
# NIC (the server configuration will need to be updated as per your specific server details):

SERVER = {
    'host':"192.168.3.14",  # The address of the remote server
    'user': 'username',  # The SSH account of the user on the remote machine
    'triple': "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",  # The LLVM target triple for compilation

    'executor_bin': "numactl -N 0 -m 0 ./catalyst-executor",
    'env': {"LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "."}
}

######################################################################
# Here, ``deploy`` and ``executor_bin`` specify the target workspace directory (including artifacts)
# and the starting command, respectively. Next, we define a remote controller on the server. As in
# the previous example, the controller is in charge of executing the quantum instructions, the only
# difference is that now it is on a remote server rather than on the same local machine where the
# quantum-classical workflow is defined.

#
# We can now define a remote GPU coprocessor on the server, and specify the Python-defined belief

######################################################################
# Since we did not specify any automatic quantum error correction, we need to explicitly perform
# encoding and decoding. As a result, we will:
#
# - **Manually encode our logical circuit** (in effect, defining
#   a **physical** circuit to be compiled and executed on the backline); and
# - **Manually measure the syndromes, decode, and apply correction**.
#
# Luckily, PennyLane and Catalyst make this easy! The

# will automatically capture and convert native Python control flow for compilation,

# You may notice a few functions that have not yet been defined, such as
# ``correction_rounds`` and ``mean_stabilizer``. Let's define them now.
#
# First up, ``correction_rounds``. This is a for loop over wires that:
#
# 1. Injects single qubit errors onto each data wire;
# 2. Performs measurements in order to extract the syndrome;
# 3. Calls the coprocessor to perform QEC decoding (via the
#    `decode <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.backline.decode.html>`__ function);
# 4. Applies the corrections to the quantum device.
#
# .. note::
#
#     ``decode`` makes a series of runtime calls directly on the
#     coprocessor. The ability to manually perform runtime calls is also available via
#     `runtime_call <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.runtime_call.html>`__.
#     If you are curious to see the internal runtime calls, `see
#     the corresponding demo in the Backline repository
#     <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/backline/blob/main/demos/demo_2a_remote_cpu_to_remote_gpu_triton_runtime_calls.py>`__.
#     This demo expands out ``decode`` into explicit ``get_session``, ``stage_payload``, ``post``, and ``collect`` calls.

# Bring your own Triton decoder
# -----------------------------
#
# With a simple modification to the above remote GPU-FPGA example, we can replace the pre-compiled
# Steane decoder with a custom Triton decoder --- all written from Python.
#
# Since we are using the Steane code, a relatively simple QEC code that uses only 7 wires to encode
# a logical qubit, the error detection splits into two independent 3-bit checks: one for bit-flips
# (:math:`X`) and one for phase-flips (:math:`Z`). Since :math:`X` and :math:`Z` errors don't
# interfere, each check has only 8 possible outcomes.
#
# Due to this low number, one decoding strategy is to simply pre-calculate every solution and store
# them in a lookup table. We can create an highly efficient Triton function that maps each
# three‑bit syndrome to a weight‑1 error.

import triton
import triton.language as tl

# The Steane decoding table: the qubit to flip for each three-bit syndrome, with -1 meaning the
# syndrome was zero and nothing needs correcting.

    word = 0
    for i, value in enumerate(values):
        word |= (no_error if value < 0 else value) << (4 * i)
    return word

# A compile-time constant, so the lookup below becomes a shift and a mask with no memory access.
STEANE_LUT = tl.constexpr(pack_lookup_table(STEANE_QUBIT_BY_SYNDROME))

def steane_lookup(syndrome):
    """Return the qubit to correct for one syndrome, or -1 if there is nothing to do."""
    idx = tl.cast(0, tl.uint32)
    for i in tl.static_range(3):
        idx |= tl.cast((syndrome >> (8 * i)) & 1, tl.uint32) << i
    qubit = (tl.cast(STEANE_LUT, tl.uint32) >> (idx * 4)) & 0xF

    # All ones is -1 read as unsigned, which is how the controller recognises "no correction".
    no_error = tl.cast(0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, tl.uint64)

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this demo, we demonstrated how PennyLane, Backline, and Catalyst eliminate the bottleneck of
# transitioning from local quantum error correction (QEC) prototyping to production-grade hardware
# deployment. By keeping the entire workflow within Python, you can dynamically connect quantum
# workloads to classical engines --- such as CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs --- without rewriting control
# logic into low-level languages. Start with simple CPU-CPU prototypes with explicit quantum
# encoding and decoding directly in Python, and rapidly scale up to remote classical accelerators,
# optimized MLIR passes, and pre-compiled GPU decoder kernels.
#
# Furthermore, the integration with Triton allows for the rapid creation of highly optimized, custom
# hardware kernels **all from Python**.
